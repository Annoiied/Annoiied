# Queer Podcast Recommendations üè≥‚Äçüåàüè≥‚Äç‚öß

Just a few recommendations :) I don't listen to a lot of podcasts myself, but these are a few worth checking out in my opinion.
## Food 4 Thot 
<sub>By Denne Michele Norris, Joseph Osmundson, Tommy Pico, and Fran Tirado</sub><br/>

A bunch of multiracial queer writers discussing everyday things about sex, relationships and gender. While I haven't listened to it myself, judging by the [trailer][f4ttrailer], their humour is one I love, they seem to have interesting insights and perspectives and are generally just a pleasure to listen to. I'll likely update this after listening!

## Gayest Episode Ever

Two gay men dissecting one-off episodes from back when any queerness on TV was still a bit of a shock. They discuss how these episodes failed and succeeded to hold up to how we see gay culture now. I've personally always found historical queer representation over the past few decades very interesting, so even if I don't know many of the shows they discuss (even in the [trailer][geetrailer]), I'll likely be giving it a listen soon.

## Sci Guys

While not an explicitly queer podcast, these guys touch upon a lot of queer subjects, and even when they don't, they do sort of ooze gay. They explain their weekly topics in understandable language to those with less knowledge on subject matters, and have interesting guests on to talk about topics they are not qualified enough to talk about.

This is the only podcast I actually listen to every single week. In fact, I should really become a patreon subscriber :)

## Two Headed Girl

A simple podcast about a married couple figuring out their identities and discussing gay themes. Honestly just seems wholesome, and I love just hearing other people's perspectives on things that I myself also will/might run into.

## Making Gay History
<sub>By Eric Marcus</sub><br/><br/>

Queer history is primarily, for various reasons people should be much more aware of, oral. this podcast is an amazing collection of elder gays, eye-witnesses, older recordings and excerpts that tell an important part of queer people's collective history.

(Not about food, they just like the pun)
